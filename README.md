# MIT_teacher_student_matching_code
The goal of this program is to match MIT undergraduates who are taking education courses with teachers around the Boston area to fulfill classroom observation requirements. This program will only be used internally for MIT students.

## v1_Brainstorming

Final draft of app code. 

## student_list and teacher_list 
CSV files that contain entries for student and teacher lists that will be used in the v2 program.
